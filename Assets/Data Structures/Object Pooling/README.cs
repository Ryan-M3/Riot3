/*  This folder contains a collection of classes which implement object pools *  for this particular game. This game has a dynamicallly loaded map, so the *  pool size changes during the course of the game. Additionally, if multiple *  types of objects are pooled simultaneously, then the performance benefits *  of a pool are subverted; pools are meant to get around having to create *  many objects at once or in quick succession. *   *  Pooling objects in each pool is handled by the WaterPark class (you could *  reductively call a water park a collection of pools). *   *  An object which needs to use a given object pool is called a Swimmer, *  because real life pools are used by people who want to go for a swim. * *  Finally, an object which can be stored in a pool is called a Poolable, *  because PoolToy or PoolFloat just didn't sound right to me. */
