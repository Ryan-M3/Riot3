# Riot3

This repo contains the files for a Unity video game I made to learn C# and demonstrate my programming skills. It requires Unity to compile and I can't guarantee that Github recognizes every little thing required to make it compile without a little tweaking on your computer (you can ask for a compiled binary if you'd like, though). It's a turn-based strategy game about putting down a riot. I'll add more detail about navigating this repo soon.
